First,
set up s_cmd:
			char **cmd;
			s_cmd *next;


First, go from sketchy_line to sexy_line
add spaces before and after meaningful operators
	command arent necessarily separated by wspaces

	ls>outfile
	becomes :
	ls > outfile

Handle operators
	as in what ever comes after is it's fd
		

make quote_split taht doesnt split spaces within quotes


the rest is the cmd's arg



open and check infiles as they come 
(possible multiple infiles => (close last fd if there is  one to close), open and check rights, 
if ok 
	proceed,
continue parsing
if there's another one directly after,
	launch ft_redir
	close previous, replace old fd by new, and start open and check rights procedure again)

even if invalid commmand, create outfile 
echod -n "iebogg" > outfile
however if invalid infile, stop there.


ALEXIE EXPECTS ASAP : 
CMD FLAG ARG
CMD FLAG ARG REDIR
REDIR CMD FLAG ARG



clean_input
	open_quotes ?
	redir into redir
		'< inf' '<< heredoc' '> outf' '>> outf' is fine
		'<>' syntax error near expected token 'newline'
		'<> outfile' creat outfile
		'< <' is not fine ("redir wspace redir" is fucked)
		>< is fucked | >>< is fucked | 
			redir requires associated fd directly after
	more than 1 pipe
	cmd name has to start with alphanum or '_'
	cmd_flag can't have more than 2 '-'
